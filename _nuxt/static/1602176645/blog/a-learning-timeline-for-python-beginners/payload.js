It's everywhere nowadays. The simplicity to write complex code and the parallel learning curve has made it the most sought after programming language. Its application can be extended to various domains such as Web development, Machine learning, Artificial intelligence and much more.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPython is extremely easy to learn and for people new to programming it's a piece of cake. The demand for good python programmers is getting skyrocketed. This is the high time to learn python and achieve expertise.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter mastering the basic concepts you can choose any of the domains of python programming which are Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science. These are the most popular domains but the application of python is extended to many fields.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI'm also a beginner of python. I have started learning python just a while ago. Javascript is my favorite language and I have been using it since the beginning. The simplicity and functionality of python forced me to try this out.

There are many android apps that offer very functional features to practice coding. If we can tailor a timeline for learning and practicing code on smartphones, the whole learning process will be a piece of cake. For every beginner the only factor which plays a big role is CONSISTENCY. If you are not consistent, you won't go anywhere with programming. There will be times when using a smartphone for coding will demotivate you but if you march on ahead with interest, you could gain a lot of knowledge.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Timeline\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWhen we try to learn a new language, it's always better to learn the basics and practice thoroughly to get a good command over the basics.
