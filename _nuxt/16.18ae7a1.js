The simplest answer is we all have a serious issue of social anxiety. Let me explain it in a simple manner. We live in a world of 7 billion people.

But we influenced the medium in such a way that it's became a marketplace of attention seekers and attention givers.It's became a door to the lives of other people where we are the invited intruders.
