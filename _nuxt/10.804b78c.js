Parenting is not just providing your kids the best education or buying them good clothes , good food ; no that's not the 100% of parenting , what actually parenting is to BELIEVE on the capabilities of your kids. Every parent should belive that his/her kids can do anything in the world. Never stop them from doing what they want. That doesn't mean you won't guide them. Just make your kids feel that they have the capability to acomplish everything. And the most important thing , never stop BELIEVING on you children.\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for reading and reach me on social media if you have anything to say.\n",html:"<p>I'm a child of 19 and it's awafully absurd for me to write about parenting.
