**Hii Guys !!!** 

It's my first time using a static site generator. It feels amazing to work with awesome new technology. I have always wanted to build something useful and functional with **Vue**. Thanks to the work of [**Code Tribe**](https://github.com/code-tribe/nuxt-netlify-cms-starter), I was able to build something extremely useful and functional. 

I hope i may tweak this project  to a greater usability and functionality. 

Thanks Peace!!
